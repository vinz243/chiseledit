# chiseledit
Chisel &amp; Bits + WorldEdit = :heart:


This adds a few commands that work similar to worldedit's, but on chisel level.

## CRot

```
/crot y <x> <z>
```

Rotate invidiual chisel for each block (but not individual block!). Use it with `//rotate`

## Cmirror

```
/cmirror
```
stand looking to a direction and flip it that way. see `//flip`
